## Requirements

- **PowerShell 5.1+**  
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and Beta Module (Beta Required for the Security Review Section)**  
  Install via:
  ```powershell
  Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope AllUsers
  Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta -Scope CurrentUser
  


## Getting Started

1. **Download Files**
   - `AetherCred-Core.ps1` (Core Script)
   - `AetherCred-Report.html` (Report Template)
   - `AetherCred-CreateApplication.ps1` (Application Creation Script)
   - `AetherCred.config` (App Information Storage)
   - `Modules/Run-ConditionalAccessReview.ps1` (Conditional Access Module)
   - `Modules/Run-LicensingReview.ps1` (License Review Module)
   - `Modules/Run-SecurityReview.ps1` (Security Review Module)
   - `Run-GroupReview.ps1` (Group Review Module)


2. **Set Up Modules**
   - Create a folder named `Modules` in the same directory as `AetherCred-Core.ps1`.
   - Place supporting module scripts inside (e.g., `Run-SecurityReview.ps1`, `Run-ConditionalAccessReview.ps1`, etc.) - Download from the Modules folder if you haven't already

3. **Create the Application**
   Open PowerShell and execute:
   ```powershell
   .\AetherCred-CreateApplication.ps1

  This will prompt you to use a user with the create permissions to create the App Registration, you must still grant admin consent and make the secret manually

4. **Fill the AetherCred.config**
   Fill out the AetherCred.config with the Tenant ID, Application ID and Secret Value from the App Registration

6. **Run the Script**
   Open PowerShell 5.1 and execute:
   ```powershell
   .\AetherCred-Core.ps1

## üß† Architecture Overview

### üß© Modular Design
Each review (security, licensing, conditional access) is handled by a separate `.ps1` module file under `/Modules`, promoting clarity and easy extensibility.

### üîê Graph API Connection
- Searches for an existing App Registration named `AetherCred`
- Automatically registers the app and assigns required permissions (e.g. `User.Read.All`, `Policy.Read.All` etc)
- Uploads a custom logo and sets redirect URIs

### üß† Interactive Review Selection
After connection, you are presented with a menu to:
- Run all reviews
- Run specific reviews independently

The core script delegates execution to functions like `Invoke-SecurityReview` or `Invoke-LicensingReview`, depending on selection.

### üì¶ Data Export & Processing
- All output data is serialised as JSON and compressed into a `.js` file (e.g., `AetherCred-Data.js`)
- Data is also saved as `.csv` for use with Excel
- A timestamp is embedded to show when the report was last generated

### üñ• HTML Dashboard
- Fully offline and self-contained
- Loads `.js` files dynamically
- Uses JavaScript to populate metrics, tables, and charts
- Includes client-side PDF export via `jsPDF` and `autotable` libraries

### üßπ Cleanup
All Graph sessions are properly disconnected after execution to prevent session leaks.

## PDF Report

The PDF export feature is fully **client-side** and requires no server. When you click **Download PDF Report** in the HTML dashboard:

1. The data is pulled directly from the `.js` files (e.g. `AetherCred-Data.js`, `AetherCred-CA-Data.js`)
2. A multi-page, landscape PDF is created in-browser
3. It includes:
   - Branded header (with logo and report title)
   - Page numbers
   - Timestamp of data
   - Full table of security attributes

This is powered by:
- [`jsPDF`](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF)
- [`jspdf-autotable`](https://github.com/simonbengtsson/jsPDF-AutoTable)

**Note:** No data is ever sent outside your browser, ensuring complete privacy.

# Data Security

AetherCred is built with security and privacy in mind. Your tenant data is never transmitted to any third-party service at any point in the workflow.

### Key Principles

- **No External Data Transfer**  
  All data collected from Microsoft Graph stays **local** to your environment. The tool does not upload, sync, or transmit any information to external servers or APIs.

- **Offline Report Generation**  
  The HTML dashboard and all generated files (`.js`, `.csv`, `.pdf`) run entirely **in your browser**. No internet connection is required after initial data collection.

- **Client-Side PDF Export**  
  PDF reports are generated using client-side JavaScript libraries (`jsPDF`, `autotable`). Nothing is sent to any cloud service or external processor.

- **Controlled Permissions**  
  When using App Registration, you define exactly which Microsoft Graph permissions are granted, enabling compliance with the principle of least privilege.

- **No Data Retention**  
  AetherCred does not log or retain any data beyond what is saved explicitly by the user as output files (`.csv`, `.js`, `.pdf`).

By design, AetherCred operates as a **self-contained and auditable** security reporting tool, suitable for both internal audits and external compliance reporting workflows.

**Do NOT hardcode your Tenant ID, Application ID and Secret Value into your script! That is not best practice, I've left the .config file to be in the same location for simple open source reference, I'd recommend storing these secretly better!**
